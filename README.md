# DNA_Sequence_check

These files in the repo contain collections of fuctions that serve to solve bioinformatic problems like:

1. Finding potential binding sites of proteins on a DNA chain, preferably with some mismatches;
2. Searching for approximated locations where DNA replication begins and ends;
3. Looking for 'clock-protein' binding sites on strings of DNA sequences, etc.

The collection of functions are stored in the files. As code development is ongoing, each file is considered a scratch.
When the entire project is done, a more concise and structured module will be generated.
